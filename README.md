## üîß Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a basic development environment. Using the **Live Server** extension in VS Code is highly recommended for the best experience.

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/codevory/course-landing-page.git](https://github.com/codevory/course-landing-page.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd course-landing-page
    ```

3.  **View the website:**
    -   Simply open the `dist/index.html` file in your browser.
    -   Or, for a better experience with live reloading, right-click on `dist/index.html` in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server".

### Building from Source (Optional)
If you want to modify the styles, you'll need to run the Tailwind CSS build process.

1.  **Run the Tailwind CLI watch command:**
    This command will watch for any changes in your source CSS files and automatically rebuild the `output.css` file.
    ```sh
    npx tailwindcss -i ./src/style.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
    ```
